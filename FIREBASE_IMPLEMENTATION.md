# Firebase Authentication Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Role System

- Removed `role` field from `User` entity in `database/User.kt`
- Removed role selection dropdown from `SignUpScreen.kt`
- Updated `AuthViewModel.kt` to remove role parameter from signUp method
- Removed all role-related variables and logic throughout the app

### 2. Added Firebase Dependencies

- Added Google Services plugin to project-level `build.gradle.kts`
- Added Firebase BOM, Auth, and Firestore dependencies to app-level `build.gradle.kts`
- Created `google-services.json` with provided Firebase configuration

### 3. Created FirebaseAuthViewModel

- New `FirebaseAuthViewModel.kt` with complete Firebase authentication logic
- Handles sign up, login, logout, and forgot password functionality
- Stores user data in Firestore database upon registration
- Uses coroutines for async operations with proper error handling

### 4. Updated UI Screens

- Updated `SignUpScreen.kt` to use `FirebaseAuthViewModel`
- Removed role selection and simplified form
- Added `ForgotPasswordDialog` component
- Updated `LoginScreen.kt` to use Firebase authentication
- Added forgot password functionality with dialog
- Updated `MainActivity.kt` to use `FirebaseAuthViewModel`

### 5. Authentication Flow

- Users sign up with: Full Name, Email, Password, Date of Birth, Gender
- User data is stored in Firestore collection "users" with user UID as document ID
- Firebase Auth handles email/password authentication
- Forgot password sends reset email via Firebase Auth
- Authentication state is managed through reactive StateFlow

### 6. Firebase Configuration

- Project ID: `careconnect-86fa4`
- Package name: `com.example.careconnect`
- Storage bucket: `careconnect-86fa4.firebasestorage.app`

## Key Features Implemented
